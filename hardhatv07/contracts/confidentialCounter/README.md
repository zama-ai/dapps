# Confidential Counter
The Confidential Counter examples demonstrate progressively more complex uses of FHE operations through four samples:

1. **Basic Counter**: Simple encrypted counter with basic increment operations
2. **Input Counter**: Handles encrypted inputs with proofs and type conversions 
3. **Decryptable Counter**: Adds decryption capabilities and state management
4. **Multi-User Counter**: Supports per-user encrypted counters with access control

Each sample builds on the previous one to showcase different FHE capabilities.
