# fhEVM dApp examples

This repository contains example dApps built using fhEVM (Fully Homomorphic EVM). Each example demonstrates different aspects of building privacy-preserving smart contracts using FHE operations.

## Examples featured

### Confidential Counter
The Confidential Counter examples demonstrate progressively more complex uses of FHE operations through four samples:

1. **Basic Counter**: Simple encrypted counter with basic increment operations.
2. **Input Counter**: Handles encrypted inputs with proofs and type conversions.
3. **Decryptable Counter**: Adds decryption capabilities and state management.
4. **Multi-User Counter**: Supports per-user encrypted counters with access control.

Each sample builds on the previous one to showcase different FHE capabilities.

### GuessRandomNumberGame

**How the Game Works**

1. **Random Target Generation**: Contract generates an encrypted random number within `MAX_VALUE` range using TFHE.

2. **Player Participation**: Players submit encrypted guesses with ZK proofs. One guess per address per round.

3. **Minimum Players**: Game requires `MIN_PLAYERS` submissions before proceeding.

4. **Winner Determination**: Uses FHE operations to privately find the closest guess to target while maintaining confidentiality.

5. **Decryption & Results**: Target, winning guess, and winner's address are securely decrypted via Zama Gateway. Results announced through `WinnerDeclared` event.

6. **Game Reset**: Automatically clears state, generates new target, and prepares for next round.

The game showcases FHE capabilities for secure random number generation, private comparisons, and controlled decryption while maintaining player privacy throughout.

### FHEWordle

**How the Game Works**

1. **Game Setup**: A factory contract deploys unique game instances for each player using minimal proxies. Each game has:
   - An encrypted target word (represented as encrypted letter indices 0-25)
   - A player address who can submit guesses
   - A relayer address who helps with FHE operations

2. **Word Submission**: The relayer submits the encrypted target word letters using `submitWord1`. The letters are stored as encrypted uint8 values.

3. **Player Guessing**: Players submit guesses by calling `guessWord1` with:
   - A word encoded as a uint32 (each letter as index 0-25).
   - A Merkle proof verifying the word is valid.
   - Limited to 5 guesses total.

4. **Guess Feedback**: After each guess, players can request feedback via `getGuess` which returns:
   - An encrypted equality mask showing exact letter matches (green).
   - An encrypted letter presence mask showing letters in wrong positions (yellow).

5. **Winning**: Players can claim victory using `claimWin` if they get all letters correct. The contract verifies this using FHE operations.

6. **Word Revelation**: After game completion, the target word can be revealed using `revealWordAndStore`.

7. **Proof Verification**: The relayer can verify game outcomes using Merkle proofs via `checkProof`.

The game leverages FHE operations to keep the target word encrypted while still allowing comparison with guesses. This prevents players from seeing the word until the game is complete.


### Decentralized Identity

**How it works**

1. **Identity Management**: The system consists of four main contracts:
   - `IdMapping`: Maps user addresses to unique IDs for identity tracking.
   - `PassportID`: Stores encrypted passport/identity data like name, birthdate.
   - `Diploma`: Manages encrypted educational credentials and degrees.
   - `EmployerClaim`: Generates verifiable claims about age and education.

2. **Identity Registration**:
   - Users first get a unique ID from `IdMapping` via `generateId()`.
   - Authorized registrars can register encrypted passport data using `PassportID.registerIdentity()`.
   - Educational institutions can register encrypted diploma data via `Diploma.registerDiploma()`.

3. **Encrypted Data Storage**: All sensitive data is stored encrypted using FHE:
   - Names, birthdates, and biometric data in `PassportID`.
   - University, degree type, and grades in `Diploma`.
   - Access controlled through TFHE permissions.

4. **Claim Generation**:
   - Users can generate verifiable claims about their identity/credentials.
   - `EmployerClaim` supports two types of claims:
     - Adult verification (18+ age check).
     - Degree verification (specific degree requirements).
   - Claims preserve privacy by using encrypted comparisons.

5. **Verification Process**:
   - Claims are generated as encrypted boolean results.
   - Employers can verify claims without seeing actual data.
   - Combined verification checks both age and education requirements.
   - Results stored as encrypted verification status.

The system leverages FHE operations to enable privacy-preserving identity and credential verification without exposing sensitive personal data.

### MyConfidentialERC20.sol

**How it works**
1. **Confidential Token**: A privacy-preserving ERC20 token using FHE with encrypted balances, transfers and approvals.

2. **Key Features**: Encrypted balances (euint64), standard ERC20 functions with FHE, and owner-restricted minting.

3. **Privacy Protection**: All operations are encrypted using TFHE, with balances visible only to transaction participants.

The contract implements confidential tokens with ERC20 compatibility using FHE for privacy.

## How to use this repo

You can either deploy the dApp on the real fhEVM coprocessor on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, or on a local Hardhat node (i.e a mocked corpocessor).

### Sepolia Testnet Deployment
1. Deploy the contract:
```bash
cd hardhat/
cp .env.example .env  # Or use custom mnemonic
npm install
npm run test # to check if everything works as it should
npm run deploy-sepolia
```
> **Note:** Use your own private mnemonic in `.env`

2. Launch frontend:
```bash
cd frontend/
cp .env.example .env  # Or use custom mnemonic
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access at [`http://localhost:4173/`](http://localhost:4173/)

### Local Development (Mocked Mode)
1. Setup local node:
```bash
cd hardhat/
cp .env.example .env  # Or use custom mnemonic
npm install
npx hardhat node
```

2. Launch frontend:
```bash
cd frontend/
cp .env.example .env  # Or use custom mnemonic
npm install
npm run dev-mocked
```

Access at [`http://localhost:4173/`](http://localhost:4173/)

#### Troubleshooting

**_Invalid nonce errors:_** 
For invalid nonce errors after restarting Hardhat node:
1. Open Metamask
2. Select Hardhat network
3. Go to `Settings` -> `Advanced` -> `Clear activity tab data`
